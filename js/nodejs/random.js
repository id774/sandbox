// The most important line in any Node file.  This function
// does the actual process of creating the server.  Technically,
// Node tells the underlying operating system that whenever a
// connection is made, this particular callback function should be
// executed.  Since we're creating a web service with REST API,
// we want an HTTP server, which requires the http variable
// we created in the lines above.
// Finally, you can see that the callback method receives a 'request'
// and 'response' object automatically.  This should be familiar
// to any PHP or Java programmer.

     // These types of things are handled automatically in server programs
     // like Apache and Tomcat, but Node requires everything to be done yourself

     // Here is some unique-looking code.  This is how Node retrives
     // parameters passed in from client requests.  The url module
     // handles all these functions.  The parse function
     // deconstructs the URL, and places the query key-values in the
     // query object.  We can find the value for the "number" key
     // by referencing it directly - the beauty of JavaScript.

     // Node requires us to explicitly end this connection.  This is because
     // Node allows you to keep a connection open and pass data back and forth,
     // though that advanced topic isn't discussed in this article.
